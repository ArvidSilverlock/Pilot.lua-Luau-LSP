I know little about this module, I do not know if it has any functionality.

All that I know is it has 3 functions:

- <code>getKeyDown</code> it has two parameters, I do not know the returns.
- <code>getMouseDown</code> it has two parameters, I do not know the returns.
- <code>map</code> it has one parameter, I do not know the returns.

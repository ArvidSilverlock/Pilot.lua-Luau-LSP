## Wiring

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "top", gap: "1rem" }}>

	<p>
		To allow your code to interact with the game world, you must first obtain a
		[<code>PilotObject</code>](/objects/PilotObject) instance. To do this, first
		make sure that you have connected the part to the [
		<code>Microcontroller</code>](/objects/Microcontroller) using a [
		<code>Port</code>](/objects/Port#Configurables) _or_ a direct connection
		_(see Figure 1)_.
	</p>

		style={{
			width: "min(500px, 25%)",
			height: undefined,
			aspectRatio: "auto",
		}}
	/>
	<p>
		You can also extend the range of the microcontroller / ports by using [
		<code>EthernetCable(s)</code>](/objects/EthernetCable) _(see Figure 2)_.

	/>
	<p>
		If your build requires connections which are not practical to link with
		wiring, you can use [<code>Routers</code>](/objects/Router) as a wireless
		bridge _(see Figure 3)_.

## API

There are four main methods for getting parts: <code>Network:GetPart</code>, <code>Network:GetParts</code>, <code>Network:GetPartFromPort</code>, and <code>Network:GetPartsFromPort</code>.
The plural variations will return an array instead of a single part. These methods are global in all microcontroller code execution sandboxes.

- <code>Network:GetPart(s)</code> will look through parts that are directly connected
  _but not_ through ports.

- <code>Network:GetPart(s)FromPort</code> will _only_ look through parts that are
  connected through ports.

These two special methods <code>Network:GetPort</code> and <code>Network:GetPorts</code> will return the port of the specified PortID, looking through all ports which are _directly connected_.

For more documentation on ethernet networks: /types/Network

#### Function signatures:

- <code>Network:GetPartFromPort(Port | number, string) → PilotObject</code>
  Gets a part of the specified type from any port of the specified ID.

- <code>Network:GetPartsFromPort(Port | number, string) → \{PilotObject}</code>
  Gets all the parts of the specified type from any port of the specified ID.

- <code>Network:GetPart(string) → PilotObject</code>
  Gets a part of the specified type from any connected parts.

- <code>Network:GetParts(string) → \{PilotObject}</code>
  Gets all the parts of the specified type from any connected parts.

- <code>Network:GetPort(number) → Port</code>
  Gets the connected port of the specified ID.

- <code>Network:GetPorts(number?) → \{Port}</code>
  Gets all the connected ports of the specified ID. If no ID is specified it will
  get all connected ports.

Note that once your code stops running and you have not binded any event listeners, the microcontroller will _shut off_. This can be an issue when making UI, as the game will delete your UI elements, and can be alleviated by simply adding <code>coroutine.yield()</code> at the end of your code. This is explained in more detail in [keeping your microcontroller enabled](/help/keeping-microcontroller-enabled)

## Examples

```lua
-- Examples
-- This code will work with all figures 1-3
local switch = Network:GetPart("Switch")
local microphone = Network:GetPartFromPort(1, "Microphone")

-- Alternatively, you can pass in a Port into GetPart(s)FromPort:
local port = Network:GetPort(1)
local microphone = Network:GetPartFromPort(port, "Microphone")
```

It is recommended to use [<code>assert</code>](/help/assert) as to avoid wiring issues. This means if for whatever reason your code failed to find the switch or microphone, it would give you an error and directly say "no microphone".

```lua
local switch = assert(Network:GetPart("Switch"), "no switch")
local microphone = assert(Network:GetPartFromPort(1, "Microphone"), "no microphone")
```

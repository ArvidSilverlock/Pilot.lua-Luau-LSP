# Types

You may see things like <code>\{ string \}</code> or <code>\{ \[string\]: number \}</code> and be rather confused, these are [luau types](https://luau.org/typecheck) (you can see how to read them by following that link).

If you don't know already, roblox uses a different version of Lua, which is called 'Luau'. Pilot.lua is the exact same language as Luau (but with some extra functions!).

These types are ways of saying how a value is formatted in a manner your LSP (the thing that gives you all the squiggles and autocompletion).

    categories:

    description: |-
      Stabilizes vehicles and structures by pointing upwards. Useful for mechs or orientating structures to the correct rotation. The gyro can also be configured to seek objects and players.

      When powered, the gyro will follow its seek commands that can be configured using hammer.
      The gyro has commands that allow it to find and seek objects and players.

      An example of gyro's seek configuration includes "Player1 Player2" which will seek and aim towards the nearest player.

      Putting "Radar" at the beginning of the seek configuration will make it target parts instead. For example, "Radar Gold Copper" will find the nearest Gold or Copper deposit.

      Putting "AllExcept" will make the seeker target everything except the given list, basically inverting it. For example, "AllExcept Player1 Player2" will target "Player3" or "Player"4 but not "Player1".

      The commands "Min" and "Max" set the minimum or maximum distance the seeker will target. For example, "Min20 Max500" will make the seeker only target objects within 500 studs and more than 20 studs away.

      TriggerWhenSeeked will trigger all connected parts every second when the Seek configurable is satisfied

      "TrigMin" and "TrigMax" work the same as "Min" and "Max" but it's for the trigger signal, trigger signal will only be sent if the above property is true.

      Putting "Sun" as part of the list will make the seeker automatically target the main stellar body in the system.

This process is extremely unhealthy, however, and may result in short-term complications.\n\nParts can be attached to the prosthetic, allowing many uses for the prosthetic limb.\n\nProsthetic limbs are also electrically conductable, acting as a wire.\n\nHeavily damages the character once attached.\nProsthetics can't have more than 50 parts attached to them.\n \t"

If there are 5 active receivers, each of them will get 100 power and 5 iron.\n\nWhen the relay is red, it means it not functioning.

    description: |-

      The speed setting of the thruster can also be configured from -100 (full backward) to 100 (full forward).

      The maximum speed of a thruster is dependent on its volume.
      Thrusters will generate more heat the larger and more powerful the thruster is. A 10x10x10 thruster, for example, would need about 8 coolers to operate.
      The power required by a thruster is proportional to its actual speed output.

      Thrusters can be heated to a temperature of around <200 degrees before overheating and combusting.
